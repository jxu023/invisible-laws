Checker::ASTVisitor

  go over each function call

doc_i
{
  fprintf(stderr, callee name) > word
  end doc
}











clang found ~50 bugs in puzzles
  should try going through puzzles manually to see if they really are bugs

  now there are 100 bugs, some of them are definitely false positives
  
create our own checker

use LSA somehow
  create a pass to go through

add a file
    add file to CMakeLists

modify code in
	~/llvm/tools/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer

compile scan-build, scan-view
	cd buildllvm
	make -j4
	sudo make install # do this if you want to avoid typing
		~/buildllv/bin/

test scan-build
	cd invisible-laws
	~/buildllvm/bin/scan-build make

clang --analyze --analyzer-checker=alpha.core.MainCallChecker test1.c

make clang - for subsequent clang dev

scan-build -enable-checker alpha.core.MainCall make

our contribution?
  LSA, common argument

  on jumping into a function, the core will analyze it, or it might be out of scope, or
